- In Part 01, we are going to build a few small, but nice projects to get you up to speed with React fundamentals, such as components, JSX, props, state, and forms.
- It also includes tons of challenges and exercises to get us coding in React on our own, right off the bat.

### Part 02

- In Part 02, we build upon these foundations to learn intermediate concepts like data fetching, the `useEffect` hook, and custom hooks.
- There is also a special section on how React works behind the scenes which will make us super confident when working with React on our own.

### Part 03

- In Part 03, we really take things to the next level and work on our advanced React skills.
- We are going to deep dive into topics like reducers and performance optimization, build our first single page app with React Router, and also explore Redux and modern Redux toolkit.

### Part 04

- In Part 04, we take all we have learned and apply it to the real world as we build two beautiful, professional applications using industry standard libraries and tools like Redux, Tailwind, React Query, Supabase, and more.
