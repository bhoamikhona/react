# Section 12: Effects and Data Fetching

**About:** Probably 95% of all React apps out there fetch some kind of data from some API, making data fetching an essential skill when building web applications. One way of fetching data in a React app is inside an effect and so, that's what this section is all about. In this section, we will continue working on the usePopcorn project as we learn all about side effects.
