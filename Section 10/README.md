# Section 10: Thinking in React - Components, Composition, and Reusability

**About:** In this section we will learn how to think about components, component composition and component reusability. Over the next few sections we are going to build a beautiful project called "usePopcorn". In this section, we lay the foundation of the project by learning deeply about how to split a user interface into components, what type of components we can use, and then how implement it all in React. We will also build a simple app layout for the first time using the power of composition. All these are already intermediate React topics but still, absolutely fundamental for any React developer.
