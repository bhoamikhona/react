# Section 06: State, Events, and Forms - Interactive Components

**About:** In this section we will keep exploring fundamental React topics and finally make our components do something i.e. we will make components interactive now. To do that, we will start learning how to handle events in React and how to update the user interface using the extremely important concept of state. We will also start building our next project where we are going to focus on state and building forms in the React way using controlled elements. By the end of the section we will summarize everything we have learned about props and state, both in theory and in practice by building a really nice and small flashcards application. So this is a super essential and foundational section.

## Lessons Learned

### Let's Build a Steps Component

- If the data, for example an array, doesn't depend on anything that is inside a component then it should be located outside of the component. This is because otherwise each time that the component is executed, the data will be created again. But, we will learn about this more, later.
