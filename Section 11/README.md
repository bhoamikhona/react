# Section 11: How React Works Behind The Scenes

**About:** This is probably the most challenging section in this course but, also one of the most exciting ones and most rewarding ones. Up until this point we have only focused on how React concepts and features work in practice, but now it is time to understand how things actually work internally - inside React, behind the scenes. This information that you are about to learn will not only make you a much better and more confident React developer, but it will also allow you to ace the most common React interview questions with all the confidence that you need in order to nail that job. This knowledge will actually put you right in the top 5% of all React developers. This section is quite intense, and it should probably be in the advanced part of the course but, since there is so many important things to cover that it was placed here. If at some point it becomes a bit overwhelming or tiring, please just at least go through the last lesson of this section where we will briefly summarize everything we covered. So, that lesson really is a must. Anyway, without further ado, let's dive right in and uncover how React works.
