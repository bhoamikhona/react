# Section 04: Review of Essential JavaScript for React

**About:** React is a JavaScript library, and therefore you will need a good understanding of some essential JavaScript fundamentals. So, if your JS is a bit rusty then this section is for you. We are going to review topics such as destructuring, the spread operator, template literals, ternaries, and asynchronous JS with promises and async/await. One of the things that we do all the time in React is to work with immutable arrays, so we will spend some time with the important array methods viz `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, and `sort()`. If you already know these things then feel free to skip this section and move right to the next one.

## Lessons Learned

### Destructuring Objects and Arrays

- Setting up Quokka

### Rest/Spread Operator

### Template Literals

### Ternaries Instead of if/else Statements

### Arrow Functions

### Short-Circuiting and Logical Operators: &&, ||, ??

- Falsy Values:
  - `0`
  - `""`
  - `undefined`
  - `null`
  - `NaN`

### Optional Chaining

### The Array map Method

- `map()`

### The Array filter Method

- `filter()`

### The Array reduce Method

- `reduce()`

### The Array sort Method

- `sort()`
  - For sorting it in an ascending way: `(a, b) => a - b`
  - For sorting it in a descending way: `(a, b) => b - a`
- `slice()`

### Working With Immutable Arrays

### Asynchronous JavaScript: Promises

### Asynchronous JavaScript: Async/Await
