# Section 04: Review of Essential JavaScript for React

**About:** React is a JavaScript library, and therefore you will need a good understanding of some essential JavaScript fundamentals. So, if your JS is a bit rusty then this section is for you. We are going to review topics such as destructuring, the spread operator, template literals, ternaries, and asynchronous JS with promises and async/await. One of the things that we do all the time in React is to work with immutable arrays, so we will spend some time with the important array methods viz `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, and `sort()`. If you already know these things then feel free to skip this section and move right to the next one.
