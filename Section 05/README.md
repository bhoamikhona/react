# Section 05: Working With Components, Props, and JSX

**About:** In this section, we are going to explore three core concepts of building React apps, viz components, props, and JSX. We will learn how components are the building blocks of React applications, and how to create and re-use them using the powerful JSX syntax. We are also going to share data between components usings props and learn about rendering lists, conditional rendering, and more, all while building our first beautiful project. Along the way, you will start practicing React on your own by building a developer profile card using these fundamental skills. So, let's get started.
