# Section 05: Working With Components, Props, and JSX

**About:** In this section, we are going to explore three core concepts of building React apps, viz components, props, and JSX. We will learn how components are the building blocks of React applications, and how to create and re-use them using the powerful JSX syntax. We are also going to share data between components usings props and learn about rendering lists, conditional rendering, and more, all while building our first beautiful project. Along the way, you will start practicing React on your own by building a developer profile card using these fundamental skills. So, let's get started.

## Lessons Learned

### Rendering The Root Component and Strict Mode

- Root Component
  - `ReactDOM.createRoot()`
    - `createRoot()` lets you create a root to display React components inside a browser DOM node.
  - `root.render()`
    - Call `root.render()` to display a piece of JSX ("React node") into the React root's browser DOM node.
- Strict Mode
  - It is really not a big deal.
  - The only thing that it does is that during development it will render all the components twice in order to find certain bugs.
  - Also, React will check if we are using outdated parts of the React API.
  - So, strict mode is nothing groundbreaking but, it is still a good idea to always activate it when we develop React applications.

### Before We Start Coding: Debugging

- Make sure the app is running.
- Try hard re-loading the browser.
- If the app is running but, it is not updating as you code, stop and re-start the app.
- Keep the chrome developers tool console open all the time when developing.
- Google the errors that appear, check stack overflow.
- Always work with ESLint.
- Check the problems tab and output tab (for prettier and ESLint) in the VS code.
