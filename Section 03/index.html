    <!-- REACT LIBRARY CDNs -->

    <!-- 
    The first library is the core React library.
    It works with components, state, and all the other React stuff.
    So, it is basically the interface of how to interact with React.
     -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>

    <!-- 
    This is React DOM, which is basically the rendering layer which can render React
    components into the DOM.

    Since we want to render in the browser, we need to use React DOM.
    
    But, React can actually be rendered in other enviornments, for example, as native
    applications using React Native.

          setInterval(function () {
            setTime(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
          }, 1000);
        }, []);

        // The `React` namespace comes from the first React library that we imported above.
        // At this point we are just creating the element, not inserting it into the DOM.
        return React.createElement(
          "header",
          null,
          `Hello, React! It's ${time}`
        );
      }

      // ReactDOM namespaces comes from the second library we imported above.
      // First we create the root element with `createRoot()`
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
      // Using the `render()` we insert the App component inside the root element.
      root.render(React.createElement(App));
